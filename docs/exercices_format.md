This section describes the format parsed by `learn-ocaml` for
exercises, tutorial and lessons.

# Exercices and groups format


## Groups

A group is either a set of exercices or other groups. As such exercices are classified
into a tree representation, where groups are nodes and leafs are exercises. This
tree (or index of exercises) can be described by a file `index.json` at the root
of the `exercises` directory from the repository. If no `index.json`
is found, the subdirectories are scanned and all exercises found are returned.

The file `index.json` has the following format (in version "1"):
```
<group name> = <string>
<directory> = <string>

<exercices> = "exercises : [ <directory>, .., <directory> ]
<groups> =
  "groups" :
    { ( <group name> : { "title" : <string>, (<groups> | <exercices> ) } )+ }

{ "learnocaml_version": <string>, <groups> }
```

For example, this `index.json` describes two groups of exercices, one with only
one exercise, two in the other:
```
{ "learnocaml_version": "1",
  "groups":
  { "imperative-traits":
    { "title": "Imperative traits",
      "exercises": [ "mooc-simple-input-output" ] },
    "data-structures":
    { "title": "Data Structures",
      "exercises": [ "mooc-binary-search-trees",
                     "mooc-trie-data-structure" ] } } }
```

This format reflects how exercises should be classified into the application.
If this file does not exists, the exercises are simply put at the root of the
index.

## Exercise

An exercise is described by a directory containing at most the following files:
- meta.json
- title.txt
- descr.html
- prelude.ml
- prepare.ml
- template.ml
- solution.ml
- test.ml
- max_score.txt

### meta.json

Json description with the following format (in version "1"):
```
{ "learnocaml_version": <string>,
  "kind": "exercise" | "problem" | "project",
  "stars": [1 .. 5]
}
```

### title.txt

Text file containing the title of the exercise.

### descr.html

Description of the exercise in HTML format.

### prelude.ml

OCaml file containing the definitions that are known by the user. In the
web-application, the prelude is shown after the exercise description. The
prelude is loaded in the environment before any other `.ml` files from the
exercise directory.

### prepare.ml

OCaml file containing some definitions that are unknown by the user. As such, it
can be used to to redefine some functions, or execute some code. For example, it
is useful to redefine some standard library functions to track their usage for
algorithmic purpose. `prepare.ml` is loaded directly after `prelude.ml` in the
environment.

### template.ml

OCaml file containing a template of code for the exercise, and loaded into the
editor by default if the user does not have a saved code for the current
exercise.

### solution.ml

OCaml file containing the solution for the exercise. It can be used for testing
the user's code by comparing its results with a code reference.

### test.ml

OCaml file containing the test program that is used to check and grade the user's code and
the solution. It has access to many functions allowing the introspection of the
code, which will be described and detailed in another section.
